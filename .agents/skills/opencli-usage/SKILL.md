# opencli-usage

OpenCLI turns any website, Electron desktop app, or external CLI into a uniform `opencli <site> <command>` surface that agents can drive without screen-scraping. This skill is the orientation layer — once you know what you want to do, load one of the specialized skills below.

## The three pillars

- **Adapter commands** — `opencli <site> <command> [...]`. Built-in adapters live in `clis/`, user adapters in `~/.opencli/clis/`. Each is backed by a strategy (`PUBLIC | COOKIE | INTERCEPT | UI | LOCAL`) that tells you whether a Chrome session is needed.
- **Browser driving** — `opencli browser *` subcommands (`open`, `state`, `click`, `type`, `select`, `find`, `extract`, `network`, …) for ad-hoc interaction and scraping when no adapter covers the task. See `opencli-browser`.
- **Current-tab binding** — `opencli browser <session> bind` attaches the Chrome tab the user already opened/logged into to that browser session. Follow-up commands use `opencli browser <session> ...`. See `opencli-browser` before using it; bound sessions still block tab mutation.
- **External CLI passthrough** — `opencli gh`, `opencli docker`, `opencli vercel`, etc. Managed via `opencli external install <name>` (auto-install from `external-clis.yaml`) or `opencli external register <name>` (bring your own).

## Install

```bash
# npm global
npm install -g @jackwener/opencli          # binary: opencli, requires Node >= 21
opencli doctor                              # run before browser-dependent work (see below)

# From source
git clone git@github.com:jackwener/OpenCLI.git
cd OpenCLI && npm install
npx tsx src/main.ts <command>               # same surface, no global install
```

`opencli doctor` prints a structured `DoctorReport` — daemon status, extension connection, version checks, and a live browser connectivity probe. Scope is narrow: it diagnoses the **browser bridge** (daemon + extension + Chrome wiring). `PUBLIC` / `LOCAL` adapters, `opencli list`, `validate`, `verify`, plugin commands, and external-CLI passthrough don't need it to be green — only `COOKIE` / `INTERCEPT` / `UI` adapters and the `opencli browser *` subcommands do. Flag: `-v` (verbose).

## Prerequisites by command type

| Strategy tag on `opencli list` | What it needs |
|--------------------------------|---------------|
| `PUBLIC` | Nothing — pure HTTP, no browser. |
| `COOKIE` | Chrome logged into the target site + **OpenCLI** extension installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/opencli/ildkmabpimmkaediidaifkhjpohdnifk). Command captures the credential from your live session — no re-login. |
| `INTERCEPT` | Same as COOKIE, plus opencli opens an automation window to capture a signed request. |
| `UI` | Same as COOKIE, full DOM interaction. |
| `LOCAL` | No browser; talks to a local/dev endpoint. |

Electron desktop apps (cursor, codex, chatwise, discord-app, doubao-app, antigravity, chatgpt-app) route through CDP against the running app — same cookie-less flow as a logged-in browser. Make sure the app is running before invoking.

## Discover what's installed — don't read this file, run a command

```bash
opencli list                    # table, grouped by site
opencli list -f json            # machine-readable; pipe to jq or your agent
opencli list | grep -i twitter  # find commands for a specific site
opencli <site> --help           # see that site's commands + flags
opencli <site> <command> --help # see positional args and command-specific flags
```

Do not hard-code adapter lists — there are 100+ sites and the count moves every week. `opencli list -f json` is the source of truth; it emits one entry per command with `{site, name, aliases, description, strategy, browser, args, columns, ...}`. For an agent, that is always better than grepping a doc.

Before falling back to raw `opencli browser` commands on high-change authenticated sites, check whether a site adapter already exposes the workflow. For example, ChatGPT web has higher-level commands for conversation reads and Deep Research result extraction; discover the current surface with `opencli chatgpt --help` or `opencli list -f json`.

## Universal flags (work on every adapter command)

| flag | effect |
|------|--------|
| `-f, --format <fmt>` | `table` (default in TTY) · `yaml` (default in non-TTY) · `json` · `plain` · `md` · `csv`. Pass explicitly when you want a specific shape; agents almost always want `-f json`. |
| `-v, --verbose` | Debug logs + stack traces on failure; also sets `OPENCLI_VERBOSE=1` for the process. |

Command-specific flags (`--limit`, `--tab`, `--filter`, …) are not universal — consult `<site> <command> --help`.

## Output formats

- `json` — pretty-printed, 2-space indent. Default choice for agents.
- `plain` — prints a single primary field for chat-style commands (`response`/`content`/`text`/`value`). Useful for piping to another tool.
- `yaml` — fallback when output is not a TTY and `-f` is not explicit.
- `table` — color-coded, site-grouped; meant for humans.
- `md`, `csv` — straightforward tabular dumps.

A few commands override the default via `cmd.defaultFormat` (e.g. chat commands default to `plain`), so don't assume without reading `--help`.

## Environment variables

| variable | default | purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OPENCLI_BROWSER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | `45` | Seconds to wait for the browser bridge. |
| `OPENCLI_BROWSER_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` | `60` | Per-command timeout. |
| `OPENCLI_CDP_ENDPOINT` | — | Manual CDP endpoint override (dev / remote Chrome / Electron). |
| `OPENCLI_CACHE_DIR` | `~/.opencli/cache` | Network capture + browser-state cache. |
| `OPENCLI_WINDOW` | command-specific | `foreground` or `background` browser window mode. |
| `OPENCLI_VERBOSE` | `false` | Verbose logging (also triggered by `-v`). |

## Self-repair

When an adapter command fails because the site changed (selectors drifted, API rotated, response schema shifted), re-run with `--trace retain-on-failure`. The error envelope includes a `trace` block pointing at `summary.md`; patch only the `adapterSourcePath` from that summary and retry. Max 3 repair rounds. The full flow is in `opencli-autofix`.

## Writing your own adapter

Two-path storage:

- **Private**: `~/.opencli/clis/<site>/<command>.js` — no build step, hot-available, not visible in the public package.
- **Public / PR**: `clis/<site>/<command>.js` — for upstream contribution; requires build.

Scaffolding & verification:

```bash
opencli browser init <site>/<command>   # generates a skeleton
opencli validate [target]               # semantic checks on the loaded registry (description, domain, pipeline step names, func|pipeline|_lazy presence, arg duplicates) — no network, no browser
opencli verify [target] [--smoke]       # run the command with synthetic args
opencli browser verify <site>/<command> # end-to-end smoke inside the bridge
```

Adapters import only `@jackwener/opencli/registry` and `@jackwener/opencli/errors`. `columns` must align 1:1 (in name and order) with keys of the object returned by `func`. For the full workflow see `opencli-adapter-author`.

## Plugins

Plugins are third-party extensions pulled from git, separate from the main adapter registry:

```bash
opencli plugin install github:user/repo    # install
opencli plugin list [-f json]              # see installed
opencli plugin update [name] | --all       # keep current
opencli plugin uninstall <name>
opencli plugin create <name>               # scaffold a new plugin
```

## External CLI passthrough

Wraps external command-line tools so you can discover + invoke them through the same `opencli …` entrypoint:

```bash
opencli external install gh    # auto-install via brew/apt/npm per external-clis.yaml
opencli external register my-tool \
    --binary my-tool \
    --install "npm i -g my-tool" \
    --desc "My internal CLI"
opencli external list
opencli gh pr list --limit 5   # passthrough; stdio is inherited, exit code propagated
opencli docker ps
```

Built-in entries live in `src/external-clis.yaml`; user overrides and additions in `~/.opencli/external-clis.yaml`. Commonly shipped: `gh`, `docker`, `vercel`, `lark-cli`, `longbridge`, `dws`, `wecom-cli`, `obsidian`, `ntn`, `tg(tg-cli)`, `discord(discord-cli)`, `wx(wx-cli)`.

Some official CLIs use shell-script installers instead of a shell-free package-manager command. Entries without an `install` config, such as `ntn`, must be installed manually from their homepage before passthrough use.

## Shell completion

```bash
opencli completion bash   # also: zsh, fish
# -> script on stdout; source or save per your shell's convention
```

## Where to go next

| If you're about to… | Load this skill |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Drive a live browser ad-hoc (no adapter available, or prototyping) | `opencli-browser` |
| Write a new adapter, or add a command to an existing site | `opencli-adapter-author` |
| Fix a broken adapter after a command failure | `opencli-autofix` |
| Route a search / lookup / research request to the right adapter | `smart-search` |

## Commands that used to exist

The following were removed in the PR #1094 consolidation — don't try to invoke them:

- `opencli explore <url>` — superseded by `opencli browser network` + `opencli browser find` for live API discovery, and by the `opencli-adapter-author` workflow for capture.
- `opencli record <url>` — removed; manual capture now lives in `opencli browser network --detail`.
- `opencli web read` / `opencli desktop *` as top-level groups — folded into their respective adapters (`opencli web read` still exists as the `web` adapter's `read` command, but there is no standalone `web` / `desktop` top-level group command).

## Don't

- Don't paste this skill's command list into your plan; it will rot. Call `opencli list -f json` at the start of a task instead.
- Don't assume every adapter needs a browser — strategy `PUBLIC` and `LOCAL` don't. Check the `strategy` field.
- Don't silently fall back from a failing adapter to a hand-rolled `fetch` — `--trace retain-on-failure` gives you the browser evidence and adapter source path. Do that first.
